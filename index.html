I'm a music and language enthusiast who enjoys travel and foreign cultures. I'm originally Scottish but was born and spent most of my life living in Belgium.
</p>

<p>
At the time of writing (October 2014) I am just about to start an 8 week program with the <a href="startupinstitute.com">Startup Institute<a/> in London which can be considered an accelerated MBA for the startup world. 

</p>

<p>
I'll be embarking on the <a href="www.startupinstitute.com/programs/curriculum/product-and-design">Product and Design track</a> at the Startup Institute where we'll be learning how to rapidly iterate websites using HTML, CSS and javascript.
